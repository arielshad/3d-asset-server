  <img src="docs/images/banner.svg" width="100%" alt="3D Asset Server: one search box for 3D models, materials, textures, HDRIs and game assets. HTTP API, MCP server, web UI and CLI.">
</p>

**3d-asset-server** searches 22 asset sites at once and downloads what you pick, ready to drop
into a game or a website. Use it from a browser, from `curl`, from the command line, or let your AI
assistant drive it over MCP.

> *"I need a low-poly tree pack, a mossy rock material and a sunset HDRI for my Three.js scene."*
>
> Your assistant calls `search_assets` three times, shows you the options with their licences, and
> `download_asset` puts glTF, textures and the HDRI into your project's `assets/` folder.

- **One query, many sources.** Results are merged and ranked, with a status line for every site.
- **Real downloads.** From free sources you get files directly: glTF with its `.bin` and textures,
  PBR maps at the resolution you ask for, HDRIs, or zipped packs (extracted for you).
- **Licence first.** Every result says what licence it has, whether it is free, and whether you
  must credit the author.
- **Honest about what's blocked.** Sites that block bots come back as links to their own search,
  so you still know where else to look.

## How it works

![Architecture: the web UI, curl, AI assistants (MCP) and the CLI all reach one server. Its REST API and MCP server call AssetService, which searches 20 sources through a caching HTTP client: 11 via APIs, 6 scraped, 3 link-only.](docs/images/architecture.svg)

What a single search does:

![One search: pick the sources that fit, search them in parallel with a timeout each, rank and merge the results, and return them with a status report for every site.](docs/images/search-flow.svg)

A slow or broken site never fails the search. It shows up in the per-site report with its error
and a link to the same search on that site.

![Sources by what they give you: 9 with search and direct download, 10 with search and a link to the asset page, 3 linked to their own search.](docs/images/source-access.svg)

Notes:

- Results without direct downloads still have full metadata and a link to the asset page.
- **CGTrader** sits behind an IP-based bot wall that often blocks cloud and datacenter IPs. It works
  from home connections. On a server, run behind a proxy with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`. When it is
  blocked, the report says so and links to CGTrader's own search.
- Scraped sites can change their HTML. If one breaks, only that source shows as failed; the others
  keep working. `npm run test:live` checks every site.

## Quick start

Needs Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arielshad/3d-asset-server.git
cd 3d-asset-server
npm install
npm run build

npm start                    # web UI + HTTP API + MCP on http://localhost:8787
node dist/cli.js mcp         # MCP over stdio, for Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor
node dist/cli.js search "low poly tree" --type model --free
```

With Docker, using the published image (no build needed):

```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 ghcr.io/arielshad/3d-asset-server
```

Or build it yourself with `docker build -t 3d-asset-server .`

---

## Web UI

Live at **<https://3d.shep.bot>**, or run `npm start` and open <http://localhost:8787>.

The website lives in [`web/`](web/): Astro with React islands, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui and Magic UI
components. Every page is pre-rendered HTML, so search engines and AI crawlers see the full content;
only the interactive parts hydrate.

| Page | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page: hero search, sources, agent setup, FAQ |
| `/search` | The search app: type chips, free/direct-download switches, source picker, per-site status, detail sheet with format/resolution picker, download, curl and agent snippets |
| `/docs` | Quick start |
| `/docs/mcp` | Setup for Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, the Claude apps and any stdio client |
| `/docs/api` | REST API guide with curl, JavaScript and Python examples |
| `/docs/api/reference` | Interactive OpenAPI reference ([Scalar](https://scalar.com), self-hosted) |
| `/docs/sources` | All sources with licences, generated from the provider registry |
| `/assets` | Curated asset collections (see [below](#asset-collections)): an index, four hubs (`/assets/hdris`, `/assets/textures`, `/assets/3d-models`, `/assets/game-assets`) and one page per topic, such as `/assets/free-sunset-hdris` |
| `/sources/<id>` | One page per source: licence, pricing, how it is searched, census numbers and its assets in the collections |
| `/docs/self-hosting` | Docker, Node, configuration, metrics |

- **Search state in the URL.** `/search?q=sunset&type=hdri&free=true` can be bookmarked or shared.
- **Detail sheet.** Licence, author, formats, polygon count and tags; pick a format and resolution to see
  exactly which files you'll get and their size; download the file or one zip; copy a curl command or a
  prompt for your agent.
- **API key.** If `ASSET_SERVER_API_KEY` is set, the page asks for the key once and remembers it.

### For AI agents

Point an agent at `https://3d.shep.bot` and it finds its way:

| URL | For |
|---|---|
| `/AGENTS.md` | The agent guide: MCP setup, REST workflow, licensing rules, an example |
| `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt` | [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) index and every guide in one file |
| `/docs/*.md` | Markdown twin of every docs page |
| `/skill/SKILL.md` | A Claude Code skill (`~/.claude/skills/3d-assets/SKILL.md`) |
| `/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 |

Requests with `Accept: text/markdown` get markdown instead of HTML (`/` → `/AGENTS.md`, sent with
`Vary: Accept`), unknown paths answer agents with a Markdown 404 that links to the docs, `llms.txt` and
the sitemap, every page advertises its twin with `Link: <…>; rel="alternate"; type="text/markdown"`,
and `curl https://3d.shep.bot` returns a JSON index that points at all of the above. `/about`,
`/contact` and `/privacy` describe who runs the service and what it records; `/docs/api/versioning`
is the versioning, deprecation and rate-limit policy.

---

## MCP: use it from an AI assistant

![An assistant calls search_assets, then get_asset, then download_asset, and tells you the licence and where the files were saved.](docs/images/mcp-flow.svg)

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add 3d-assets -e ASSET_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$PWD/assets" -- node /path/to/3d-asset-server/dist/cli.js mcp
```

### Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any stdio MCP client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3d-assets": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/3d-asset-server/dist/cli.js", "mcp"],
      "env": { "ASSET_DOWNLOAD_DIR": "/path/to/your/game/assets" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote (Streamable HTTP)

The public server needs no setup or key:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http 3d-assets https://3d.shep.bot/mcp
```

Other clients: see <https://3d.shep.bot/docs/mcp>. For your own server, point the client at
`http://<host>:8787/mcp`. If you set `ASSET_SERVER_API_KEY`, send
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

Over HTTP, `download_asset` is off by default because it would write to the server's disk, not
yours. Instead, `get_asset` returns direct file URLs plus a one-click `bundleUrl` zip. Set
`ASSET_SERVER_HTTP_DOWNLOADS=true` if the server and the files should live on the same machine.

### Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_assets` | `query`, plus optional `types` (model, texture, material, hdri, sprite, ui, audio, font, pack), `providers`, `free_only`, `downloadable_only`, `limit`, `offset`. Returns ranked results, `also_search_on` links for link-only sites, and any sites that failed. |
| `get_asset` | Details for an id such as `polyhaven:ArmChair_01`: description, licence, available formats and resolutions, and exactly which files a download would fetch for a given `format` / `resolution`. |
| `download_asset` | Saves into `<dest_dir>/<provider>-<id>/` (default `./assets`), keeps companion files in place and extracts zips. Returns the paths, licence and an attribution line when credit is required. |
| `list_providers` | Every source: what it's best for, asset types, pricing, licence, and whether it supports direct downloads. |

---

## HTTP API

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/search?q=&type=&providers=&free=&downloadable=&limit=&offset=` | Ranked, merged results plus a per-site report (`ok`, `error`, `timeout`, `skipped`, `link`). |
| `GET /v1/providers` | The source catalogue. |
| `GET /og/query.png?q=&type=&free=` · `GET /og/asset.png?id=` | 1200×630 share cards for search and asset links (see below). |
| `GET /v1/catalog` | Catalog census, counted daily: listings per source, by asset type, licence and category, free and CC0 counts, the last 30 days' releases, most downloaded assets. Same as `/catalog.json`; daily history at `/catalog-history.json`. |
| `GET /v1/stats` | Usage totals (searches by surface, downloads, MCP tool calls, top clients and asset types) and per-source health (success rate, p50/p95 latency). Shown on [/stats](https://3d.shep.bot/stats). |
| `GET /v1/assets/{provider}:{id}` | Full details, including every file. |
| `GET /v1/assets/{id}/files?format=&resolution=&maps=&all=` | The files a download would fetch. |
| `GET /v1/assets/{id}/download?format=&resolution=` | `302` to the file when it is one self-contained file; otherwise a streamed zip with its companions. |
| `POST /mcp` | MCP endpoint (Streamable HTTP, stateless). |
| `GET /openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 description. |
| `GET /` | Web UI in a browser; a JSON index of endpoints for API clients. |
| `GET /health` | Liveness check. |

```bash
curl 'localhost:8787/v1/search?q=brick+wall&type=material&free=true&limit=5'
curl -OJ 'localhost:8787/v1/assets/polyhaven:WoodenChair_01/download?format=gltf&resolution=1k'
```

## Downloads

Unless you say otherwise, a download picks game- and web-friendly files:

| Asset type | Preferred format, in order | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| model | glb → gltf → fbx → obj → blend | closest to 2k |
| hdri | hdr → exr | closest to 2k |
| material | jpg maps → png maps → zip | closest to 2k |
| texture | jpg → png → zip → exr | closest to 2k |
| pack | zip (extracted) | – |

Companion files keep their relative paths, so a glTF loads straight away:

```text
  assets/
  └── polyhaven-WoodenChair_01/
      ├── WoodenChair_01_2k.gltf
      ├── WoodenChair_01.bin
      └── textures/
          ├── WoodenChair_01_diff_2k.jpg
          ├── WoodenChair_01_nor_gl_2k.jpg
          └── WoodenChair_01_arm_2k.jpg

  assets/
  └── kenney-nature-kit/              ← zip downloaded and extracted
      └── kenney_nature-kit/
          ├── Models/GLTF format/...
          └── License.txt
```

Safety:

- Only `http(s)` URLs to public hosts are fetched. Private and loopback addresses are refused.
- Paths that try to escape the target folder (zip-slip, `../`) are rejected or skipped.
- Each download has a size guard (`ASSET_SERVER_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`, default 2 GiB).
- Login, checkout and hotlink protection are never bypassed.

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` / `HOST` | `8787` / `0.0.0.0` | HTTP bind address |
| `ASSET_SERVER_API_KEY` | – | Require `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `x-api-key` or `?api_key=` on `/v1/*` and `/mcp` |
| `ASSET_SERVER_PUBLIC_URL` | request origin | Base URL used in links handed to MCP clients |
| `ASSET_SERVER_PROVIDERS` | all | Comma list to enable only some sources, e.g. `polyhaven,ambientcg,kenney` |
| `ASSET_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `./assets` | Default download folder for MCP |
| `ASSET_SERVER_HTTP_DOWNLOADS` | `false` | Expose `download_asset` on the HTTP MCP endpoint (writes to the server's disk) |
| `ASSET_SERVER_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` | 2 GiB | Per-download size guard |
| `ASSET_SERVER_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` | `12000` | Per-site search timeout |
| `ASSET_SERVER_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Per-request HTTP timeout |
| `ASSET_SERVER_CACHE_TTL_MS` | 10 min | In-memory HTTP cache TTL |
| `ASSET_SERVER_USER_AGENT` | `3d-asset-server/0.1` | User-Agent sent to the sites |
| `BLENDERKIT_API_KEY` | – | Optional; unlocks plan and purchased BlenderKit assets |
| `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` | – | Set to `1` so Node's `fetch` uses `HTTPS_PROXY` |
| `ASSET_SERVER_RATE_LIMIT` | `120` | Requests per client per window on `/v1/*` and `/mcp`; responses carry `RateLimit-Policy` / `RateLimit` (+ `RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset`), and `429` adds `Retry-After`. `0` = off |
| `ASSET_SERVER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `60` | Rate-limit window in seconds |
| `METRICS_PORT` | – | Serve Prometheus metrics on this port at `/metrics` and log one JSON line per search, download and MCP tool call (see below) |
| `PROMETHEUS_URL` | – | Prometheus that scrapes `METRICS_PORT`. `/v1/stats` (and the `/stats` page) then report the last 24 hours and 7 days across replicas; without it they count this process since it started |
| `ASSET_SERVER_TELEMETRY` | on | `0` (or `false`/`off`) turns off anonymous usage telemetry; see [Telemetry](#telemetry) |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK` | – | `1` also turns telemetry off |
| `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` | – | With `UMAMI_HOST`: send web page views to your own [Umami](https://umami.is) instead (cookieless; honours Do Not Track; only `utm_*` query parameters are sent, never search text). The page CSP allows that one origin |
| `UMAMI_HOST` | – | Origin serving the Umami tracker (`/script.js`) and its collect endpoint (`/api/send`) |

> If you set `ASSET_SERVER_API_KEY` on a public server, note that `?api_key=` (used by the web UI's
> download button) can end up in browser history and server logs.

### Analytics

With `METRICS_PORT` set ([`src/core/analytics.ts`](src/core/analytics.ts)), metrics are served on that
separate port (never on the public listener), with bounded labels only:

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `asset_server_searches_total` | surface (`web`, `api`, `mcp`), client family, type, free_only, has_results |
| `asset_server_search_duration_seconds`, `asset_server_search_results` | surface |
| `asset_server_provider_requests_total`, `asset_server_provider_duration_seconds` | provider, status |
| `asset_server_downloads_total`, `asset_server_asset_views_total` | surface, client, provider |
| `asset_server_mcp_tool_calls_total`, `asset_server_mcp_tool_duration_seconds` | tool, client (claude-code, cursor, vscode, …) |
| `asset_server_http_requests_total`, `asset_server_page_views_total` | route / page |

Each search also logs `{"event":"search","query":…,"results":…,"surface":…}` to stdout for top-query and
zero-result analysis in a log store. No IPs, keys or cookies are recorded. In the shep.bot cluster a
ServiceMonitor ([`deploy/servicemonitor.yaml`](deploy/servicemonitor.yaml)) feeds Prometheus, Loki
collects the event lines, and the *3D Asset Server* Grafana dashboard shows both.

The public [/stats](https://3d.shep.bot/stats) page reads the same counters back through `GET /v1/stats`
([`src/core/stats.ts`](src/core/stats.ts)): from Prometheus when `PROMETHEUS_URL` is set (cached for a
minute), otherwise from in-process tallies since the last restart. It shows aggregate counts only.

### Telemetry

`serve` and `mcp` send anonymous usage telemetry by default, so we can see how the project is used
outside 3d.shep.bot. It goes to the project's self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is) at `stats.shep.bot`
([`src/core/telemetry.ts`](src/core/telemetry.ts)), and the server prints a one-line notice to stderr
when it starts.

- **Events:** one per search, asset lookup, download and MCP tool call, plus one at start. Each carries
  only bounded labels: interface (`web`, `api`, `mcp`), client family (`claude-code`, `cursor`, …),
  source, asset-type filter, whether anything was found, outcome, version, mode and OS.
- **Web UI page views,** when you open the bundled website: page path and title, screen size, browser
  and language. The host name is reported as `self-hosted`, and no referrer is sent.
- **Never sent:** search text, asset IDs, file paths, URLs, API keys or your machine's name. Umami
  derives a country from your IP address and does not store the address. No cookies.

Turn it off with `ASSET_SERVER_TELEMETRY=0` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`. Sending never blocks a request, and the
process stops trying after a few failures in a row (for example when offline).

### Catalog census

[`.github/workflows/catalog-census.yml`](.github/workflows/catalog-census.yml) runs
[`scripts/census.mjs`](scripts/census.mjs) daily: every provider's `census()` counts what its site
holds in a few requests (API totals, catalogues, WordPress `X-WP-Total`, result counts or sitemaps; see
[`src/core/census.ts`](src/core/census.ts)). The result is committed to `web/src/data/catalog.json` with
one point per day in `catalog-history.json`, then CI deploys it. It feeds the
[/stats](https://3d.shep.bot/stats) page, the homepage numbers, `llms.txt`, `/v1/catalog` and a
schema.org `Dataset`.
- Counts the source caps (BlenderKit stops at 10,000 per type) are marked as lower bounds.
- A source whose count fails keeps its last good numbers, marked `stale`.

The same workflow then refreshes the [asset collections](#asset-collections)
(`scripts/snapshot-collections.mjs`) and commits both.

### Asset collections

Search pages (`/search?q=…`) are `noindex`: they are share links, not landing pages. The pages that rank
are the collections: one page per thing people search for ("free sunset HDRIs", "free brick textures",
"free low-poly trees"), pre-rendered with real results, editorial copy, an FAQ and `CollectionPage` /
`ItemList` / `FAQPage` JSON-LD, plus a Markdown twin for agents (`/assets/<slug>.md`, with asset ids).

- **Topic:** [`web/src/content/collections/<slug>.md`](web/src/content/collections/). The frontmatter holds
  the title, description, hub, the search (`q`, `types`, `free`, and an `exclude` list of title phrases
  or asset ids that never belong on the page), aliases, related pages and the FAQ. The body is the copy.
  [`scripts/lib/topics.mjs`](scripts/lib/topics.mjs) holds the editorial rules (lengths, links, FAQ), and
  the tests apply them to every topic.
- **Results:** `web/src/data/collections/<slug>.json`, written by
  [`scripts/snapshot-collections.mjs`](scripts/snapshot-collections.mjs) (logic in
  [`src/core/collections.ts`](src/core/collections.ts)). It keeps relevant, free results that have a
  working thumbnail, at most 40% from one source. Assets already on a page keep their place, so pages
  don't reshuffle daily, and `updatedAt` (the sitemap's `lastmod`) moves only when the list changes. A
  page with fewer than 12 assets or a single source is `noindex` and left out of the sitemap.
- **Adding one by hand:** write the topic file, run `npm run build:server && node scripts/snapshot-collections.mjs <slug>`,
  read the titles in the snapshot, add `exclude` phrases for anything off-topic, and commit both files.

[`.github/workflows/draft-collections.yml`](.github/workflows/draft-collections.yml) proposes up to 3 new
collections every Monday:

1. [`scripts/collection-ideas.mjs`](scripts/collection-ideas.mjs) reads the last week's searches from
   Loki through Grafana. It keeps queries made at least 3 times that look like plain topics and that no
   collection or open pull request covers.
2. A Claude Code agent ([`prompts/draft-collections.md`](prompts/draft-collections.md)) writes the topic
   files and checks their results. It works in a read-only checkout, and its transcript stays out of the
   public log because it reads search terms.
3. A job without Claude credentials gates the patch
   ([`scripts/collection-gate.mjs`](scripts/collection-gate.mjs): new topic files only, editorial rules,
   no duplicates). It re-runs each search itself, withdraws topics with too few results, runs the build,
   typecheck and tests, and opens a pull request labelled `collections`.
4. A second Claude Code run reviews the pages ([`prompts/review-collections.md`](prompts/review-collections.md)).
   Approved pages are squash-merged and deployed. Otherwise the pull request is labelled `needs-editor`
   and left for a human.

It needs the same Claude secret as source discovery. It also needs the repository setting **Allow GitHub
Actions to create and approve pull requests** (Settings → Actions → General). The optional
`GRAFANA_TOKEN` secret is a Viewer service-account token for grafana.shep.bot; without it, the agent
picks topics from its own research.

### Share previews (Open Graph)

Every page has its own 1200×630 card (`og:image` = `/og/<page>.png`), rendered at build time by
[`web/integrations/og-images.mjs`](web/integrations/og-images.mjs) from the page's title and
description, with matching `og:image:alt`, `twitter:*` tags and a `primaryImageOfPage` ImageObject in
the JSON-LD. Share links get cards rendered on request ([`src/og/render.ts`](src/og/render.ts): satori +
resvg, Geist font; [`src/api/og.ts`](src/api/og.ts): LRU cache, two renders at a time, rate-limited):

- `/search?q=brick+wall&type=material`: title, description, `og:url` and a card for the query
  (`/og/query.png?…`).
- `/search?asset=polyhaven:ArmChair_01`: opens that asset in the search app (the detail panel's
  **Share** button copies this link) and unfurls with the asset's title, licence, formats and thumbnail
  (`/og/asset.png?id=…`; the thumbnail is fetched from public hosts only and re-encoded with sharp).

### Daily source discovery

[`.github/workflows/discover-integrations.yml`](.github/workflows/discover-integrations.yml) runs once a
day (and on demand from the Actions tab):

1. A Claude Code agent follows [`prompts/discover-integrations.md`](prompts/discover-integrations.md). It
   searches the web for 3D asset sites that are not yet in
   [`integrations/registry.json`](integrations/registry.json), checks their robots.txt and terms,
   integrates the best one as a provider with offline and live tests, and records the others as
   rejected with a reason. It works in a read-only checkout and hands over a patch.
2. A separate job without Claude credentials applies the patch and gates it
   ([`scripts/integration-gate.mjs`](scripts/integration-gate.mjs)):
   - only provider, test, fixture, registry and docs files may change;
   - nothing may be deleted, and existing tests may not be edited;
   - at most one new source per run.

   It then runs the build, typecheck, the full test suite and the new source's live test.
3. If everything passes, it commits to `main` and dispatches CI, which builds the image and pins it in
   `deploy/`, so ArgoCD rolls the new source out to 3d.shep.bot. If a check fails, the site is recorded
   as rejected with a 30-day recheck instead.

It needs one repository secret: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`) or
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Adding a source: implement the `Provider` interface (see
[docs/PROVIDERS_GUIDE.md](docs/PROVIDERS_GUIDE.md)), add it to `src/providers/index.ts`, and add an
offline test with fixtures.

```ts
interface Provider {
  id, name, homepage, description, assetTypes
  access: "api" | "scrape" | "link"
  pricing, license
  search(query, ctx): { assets, total?, searchUrl? }
  getAsset?(id, ctx): { ...asset, files[] } | null
  buildSearchUrl(query): string   // the same search on the site
}
```

---

## Development

```bash
npm ci && npm --prefix web ci
npm test            # offline tests (fixtures, no network)
npm run test:live   # live smoke tests against the real sites
npm run typecheck   # server + website (astro check)
npm run build       # server to dist/, then the website to dist/web
npm run dev         # watch-mode server
npm --prefix web run dev   # website dev server; proxies /v1 and /mcp to `npm start` on :8787
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs build, typecheck and tests on every push and pull request; on
`main` it also publishes the image and pins it in `deploy/`, which ArgoCD rolls out to 3d.shep.bot.

## Licences & etiquette

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This server finds and fetches assets. It does not own them. Every result shows its licence:
> respect it, and credit authors when it says so.

- Sites are queried gently: responses are cached, there are a few requests per search, and the
  User-Agent identifies the server.
- Paid, login-gated and hotlink-protected content is never bypassed; those results link to the
  source site.
- ShareTextures' terms forbid automated downloads, so it is search-only.

The server's own code is licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE).
